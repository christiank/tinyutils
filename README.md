This is a collection of super-short shell scripts for maintenance and other
common tasks. Each of them really don't deserve a repository of its own.
BTW, all of this code is in the public domain.

  - **buildsearch** -- creates a sort of fine-tuned "locate" kind of
    database.

  - **search** -- searches the database created with buildsearch.

  - **now** -- prints the date in my preferred format. Also used in my
    Ratpoison config.
